# Health Monitoring Model

The idea behind this part of the project is to monitor vital activities in the elderly, specifically (heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature), to identify risks before they occur. This is done by classifying health conditions into one of three categories:
Normal
Uncomfortable
Critical

by training a machine learning model (decision tree) on a dataset specifically designed for the elderly.
