# Fall Detection Model

This part of the project is based on detecting falls in elderly people using a camera.

In the first phase, computer vision and machine learning techniques were used to detect falls using the MediaPipe library and a random forest model.

In the second phase, computer vision techniques were developed for image processing and deep learning to achieve higher accuracy.
